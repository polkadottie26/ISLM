# IS-LM model, Simplified Keynesian 
Data Analytics MGMT 6550

 Data are quarterly, Jan 2017 to Oct 2019  
 all dollar amounts are billions  
 all data from 'FRED' Federal Reserve bank St. Louis  
 
Actual data from the past 3 years.  Can this provide insight into
economic policy?  Specifically the COVID19 virus will have exogenous effects on the US economy, what policies (fiscal/monetary) would serve to minimize the effect of decreased production and trade?

## Equations:  
   descriptions: Economic goals  
   Full Employment GDP is estimated to be $21700B
   interest rate aroud 1%
   
### IS - investment saving..  
  Y = C + I + G - Nx   macro economic description  
      C = C0 + b $\times$ Taxes    
      I = I0 + dY $\times$ Y + dInt $\times$ interest  
      G, Nx are exogenous  


###  LM - liquidity preference for money
  M/P = M0 + m1 $\times$ Y + m2 $\times$ interest     

### IS curve: 
 Y = (C0 + b $\times$ (Y-Tax) + I0 + dY $\times$ Y +dInt $\times$ interest + G - Nx )  
 write two IS functions:  
 IS_Y, solve for y in the IS equation  
 IS_i, solve for interest in the IS equation  

### LM curve:  
 write two LM functions:    
 LM_Y, solve for Y in the M/P equation  
 LM_i, solve for i in the M/P equation  

## Quesions:
For this exercise assume Full Employment GDP is $21700B, and Nx = -500

 1. Given the last values of the variables, (estimates of current US       macroeconomic values)
 
   a.  What is the equilibrium level of GDP predicted by IS_Y?
 
   b.  If these are difference from the present levels, for example if predicted GDP exceeds full employment GDP or interest rate is negative,  
what does this model suggest about the US economy?

 2. Policy- the COVID19 virus will likely reduce GDP  by 1 or 2 % and
    change Nx by about 5%-10% (we import less).  Given this,
    What policy measures does the IS-LM model suggest as a way to
    maintain GDP?    

##  FUNCTIONS -------------------------------------------------- 

## consumption function  
 consumption is a function of disposable income, (Y - tax) 

```{r}
disposableY = Y-Taxes
consumpFcn=glm(Consum ~ disposableY) # Y-Taxes is disposable income
summary(consumpFcn)
#get the coefficients for later use
C0 = as.numeric(consumpFcn$coefficients[1])
b = as.numeric(consumpFcn$coefficients[2])

consumption=function(Y, Taxes, C0, b){
  disposableY = Y-Taxes
  return(C0+b*disposableY)
}

plot(Y, consumption(Y, Taxes, C0, b), ylab='Consumption', type  = 'l',main='FRED data 2017-2019')
points(Y,Consum, pch='x')
grid()
```

## investment function
```{r}

investFcn = glm(Invest ~ Y + interestRate)
summary(investFcn)
I0 = as.numeric(investFcn$coefficients[1])
dY = as.numeric(investFcn$coefficients[2])
dInt = as.numeric(investFcn$coefficients[3])

investment = function(Y, interestRate){
  return(I0 + dY*Y +dInt*interestRate)
}

plot(Y, investment(Y, interestRate), type='l',main='FRED data 2017-2019', ylab = 'Investment')
points(Y,Invest, pch='x')
grid()
```

## demand for money function
```{r}
moneyFcn = glm(MoverP ~ Y + interestRate)
summary(moneyFcn)
M0 = moneyFcn$coefficients[1]
m1 = moneyFcn$coefficients[2]
m2 = moneyFcn$coefficients[3]

demandM = function(Y, Int_R, M0, m1, m2){
  return( M0 + m1*Y + m2*Int_R)
}

plot(Y, demandM(Y, interestRate, M0, m1, m2), type='l', ylab = 'demand for $', main='FRED data 2017-2019')
points(Y, MoverP, pch='x')
grid()

```
  
## IS -
Innvestment/saving  formula from in class

Y from IS equation
```{r}

IS_Y = function(C0, b, I0, dY, dInt, intRate, tax, G, Nx){
  # C0, b:  coefficients from consumption function
  # I0, dY, dInt: coefficients from investment function
  # intRate:  interest rate
  # Tax, G, Nx: government spending, net exports, exogenous
  Y = (C0-b*tax  + I0 + dInt*intRate + G - Nx)/(1-dY-b)
  return(Y)
}

```

```{r}

IS_i = function(Y, C, I0, dY, dInt, G, Nx){
  intR = (Y -C -I0 -dY*Y-G +Nx)/dInt
  return(intR)
}
```


## LM
interest from LM

```{r}

LM_i = function(MoverP,Y, M0, m1, m2){
  intR = (MoverP - M0 - m1*Y)/m2
  return(as.numeric(intR))
}
```


GDP from LM
```{r}
LM_Y = function(MoverP,intR, M0, m1, m2){
  Y = (MoverP-m2*intR)/m1
  return(Y)
}
```

### 1. find values of Tax and g_sPend the result in interestRate  around 1% Using IS

```{r targets}

#Macro economic targets these are fixed----
Y_FE = 21700 #Full Employment GDP
netX =-450
intR = 1.0
#------------------------------------------

#Fiscal policy--  YOU adjust these
Tax = 2000
g_Spend = 7500

#Monetary policy--  YOU set this
mOp = 3950 # money supply

#-------------------------------------------------------

C = consumption(Y_FE, Tax, C0, b)
print(paste('consumption: ',C))

I = investment(Y_FE, intR)
print(paste('investment: ',I))

equilibIntRate=LM_i(mOp,Y, M0, m1, m2)
plot(Y,equilibIntRate, ylab = 'LM interest', type='l',main='FRED data 2017-2019')
grid()


equilibriumY = IS_Y( C0, b, I0, dY, dInt, equilibIntRate, Tax, g_Spend, netX)
plot(Y, equilibriumY, type='l',main='FRED data 2017-2019')
grid()

GDP = C + I + g_Spend - netX
print(paste('national income accounting GDP: $', round(GDP)))
```

### 2. using interest rate from IS above, find mOp to match intR.  Keep GDP around $21700B

```{r}
# Monetary policy set money supply

LM_i(mOp,Y_FE, M0, m1, m2)
```

Write up your results; given the likely effects of COVOD19, what Econ
policy recommendations are made by the IS-LM model?

Include your recommendations for:
1. Federal taxes- tax cut, increase federal taxes, of leave at curreint level?  What is the dollar amound of taxes that best serves to make predicted GDP around $21700B
2. Money supply: what level makes the most sense to maintain interest around 1%?
3. Government spending: should government spending be increased, decreased or left at current levels?   What dollar amount do you recommend for government spending

Do your recommedations seem reasonable, given this is an election year?
