## Equations:  
   descriptions:    
   
### IS - investment saving..  
  Y = C + I + G - Nx   macro economic description  
      C = C0 + b $\times$ Taxes    
      I = I0 + dY $\times$ Y + dInt $\times$ interest  
      G, Nx are exogenous  


###  LM - liquidity preference for money
  M/P = M0 + m1 $\times$ Y + m2 $\times$ interest     

### IS curve: 
 Y = (C0 + b $\times$ (Y-Tax) + I0 + dY $\times$ Y +dInt $\times$ interest + G - Nx )
 write two IS functions:  
 IS_Y, solve for y in the IS equation  
 IS_i, solve for interest in the IS equation  

### LM curve:  
 write two LM functions:    
 LM_Y, solve for Y in the M/P equation  
 LM_i, solve for i in the M/P equation  

## Quesions:

For this exercise assume Full Employment GDP is $21700B, and Nx = -500

 1. Given the last values of the variables, (estimates of current US       macroeconomic values), what is the equilibrium level of GDP predicted by IS_Y?  What does this GDP suggest about possible recession?
 

 2. Policy- the COVID19 virus will likely reduce GDP  by 1 or 2 % and     change Nx by about 5% or more (we import less).  Given this, What policy measures does the IS-LM model suggest as guidelines to maintain full-employment GDP?    

##  FUNCTIONS -------------------------------------------------- 

## consumption function  
 consumption is a function of disposable income, (Y - tax) 

```{r}
disposableY = Y-Taxes
consumpFcn=glm(Consum ~ disposableY) # Y-Taxes is disposable income
summary(consumpFcn)
#get the coefficients for later use
C0 = as.numeric(consumpFcn$coefficients[1])
b = as.numeric(consumpFcn$coefficients[2])

consumption=function(Y, Taxes, C0, b){
  disposableY = Y-Taxes
  return(C0+b*disposableY)
}
```

## investment function
```{r}

investFcn = glm(Invest ~ Y + interestRate)
summary(investFcn)
I0 = as.numeric(investFcn$coefficients[1])
dY = as.numeric(investFcn$coefficients[2])
dInt = as.numeric(investFcn$coefficients[3])

investment = function(Y, interestRate){
  return(I0 + dY*Y +dInt*interestRate)
}
```

## demand for money function
```{r}
moneyFcn = glm(MoverP ~ Y + interestRate)
summary(moneyFcn)
M0 = moneyFcn$coefficients[1]
m1 = moneyFcn$coefficients[2]
m2 = moneyFcn$coefficients[3]
```

  
## IS -
Innvestment/saving  formula from in class

Y from IS equation
```{r}

IS_Y = function(C0, b, I0, dY, dInt, intRate, tax, G, Nx){
  # C0, b:  coefficients from consumption function
  # I0, dY, dInt: coefficients from investment function
  # intRate:  interest rate
  # Tax, G, Nx: government spending, net exports, exogenous
  Y = (C0-b*tax  + I0 + dInt*intRate + G - Nx)/(1-dY-b)
  return(Y)
}

```

```{r}

IS_i = function(Y, C, I0, dY, dInt, G, Nx){
  intR = (Y -C -I0 -dY*Y-G +Nx)/dInt
  return(intR)
}
```

## LM
interest rate from LM
```{r}

LM_i = function(MoverP,Y, M0, m1, m2){
  intRate = (MoverP - M0 - m1*Y)/m2
  return(as.numeric(intRate))
}
```

### Question # 1:  
use function LM_Y and last values from the data set to estimate equilibrium value of Y

GDP from LM
```{r}
LM_Y = function(MoverP,intR, M0, m1, m2){
  Y = (MoverP-m2*intR)/m1
  return(Y)
}
```

### Question # 2a: 
find values of Tax and g_Spend the result in interestRate close to 
1% Using IS_i

IS  
```{r}

#Macro economic targets-  Use these or other values that make sense
# for the US economy
Y_FE = 21700  # this is Full - employment GDP, can't go higher

netX =-490 # Estimate decrease in net exports, can change a bit
intR = 1.0 # current rate is around 1%

#Fiscal policy--  change these to get an idea of gov't fiscal policy
Tax = 3000  # tax cut??
g_Spend = 6600  # increase government spending? usually happens in an 
                #  election year

C = consumption(Y_FE, Tax, C0, b)
print(paste('consumption: ',round(C,2)))

I = investment(Y_FE, intR)
print(paste('investment: ',round(I,2)))

equilibIntRate = IS_i(Y_FE, C, I0, dY, dInt , g_Spend, netX)
print(paste('equilib interest: ',round(equilibIntRate,2)))



```

### Question 2b:   
Using interest rate from IS above, find money supply (mOp) to match equilibIntRate

```{r}
# Monetary policy set money supply
#Monetary policy change his to change equilibrium interest; This plays a
# role in the LM equation
mOp = 3782# money supply

predInt = LM_i(mOp,Y_FE, M0, m1, m2)
print(paste('predicted interest = ', round(predInt,3)))
```
<!-- negative interest rates are not OK; need a value near 1% -->

```{r}
Tax = 3500
print(paste('Tax = ', Tax))
g_Spend = 4968
print(paste('g_Spend =', g_Spend))

Ypred = IS_Y(C0, b, I0, dY, dInt, predInt, Tax, g_Spend, netX)
print(paste('pred Y = ',Ypred))
print(paste('Full Employment GDP = ',round(Y_FE,2)))
```



```{r}
Tax = 2190
print(paste('Tax = ', Tax))
g_Spend = 4500
print(paste('g_Spend = ', g_Spend))

Ypred = IS_Y(C0, b, I0, dY, dInt, predInt, Tax, g_Spend, netX)
print(paste('pred Y = ',Ypred))
print(paste('Full Employment GDP = ',round(Y_FE,2)))
```


Write up your results; given the likely effects of COVID19, what Econ
policy recommendations may be inferred from the ISLM model?

Do these recommedations seem reasonable?

## Conclusions:
### Summarize your findings
<!-- write up conclusions here -->

The Keynes simplified model implies that:
mOp = 3782, Tax = 3500, & g_Spend = 4968.
This gives "predicted interest =  0.996" & "pred Y =  21701.1801909842"
This seems unreasonable because the tax is too high.
